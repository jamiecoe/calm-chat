## Summary of ‘Little Window’ discussion on 21st Jan 2018
### Our current concept: 'A chatbot featured on all Chayn websites in an iframe, which quickly directs users to Chayn’s relevant internal or external resources'

This would be comprised of:

- A front-end display (potentially using [BotPress](https://botpress.io/))
- A node server
- An NLP API (potentially [DialogFlow](https://dialogflow.com/))
- A google sheet with Chatbot responses, accessible to Chayn staff ([Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/))
- A database to store chatbot interactions, this must be secure / up-to-date with new [laws](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/)

Next sprint and beyond features could include:
- Multi-lingual chatbot

### Tasks for the team
- Any requests for Hera (e.g.: Most commonly asked questions, google analytics) need to be sent before **Saturday 27th Jan**
- Investigate integrating an iframe window into a wordpress website
- Investigate using Google Sheets to store our Chatbot responses, where they can be easily accessed and edited by Chayn staff
- Investigate best methodology for Google Sheet management, e.g.: version control, backing up .csv files
- Research mental health chatbots, and the type of language that should be used (It should be made clear people are speaking to a chatbot and not a human!)
- User personas need to consider a global audience, with no personal pronouns- Think about our ‘metrics for success’ and how we are going to measure this


### Other important info
- Hera is available via email / phone / skype, also WhatsApp for quick questions
- Hera is around in London from **Monday Feb 12th**
- User testing could consist of online questions, in-person interviews (more difficult) or Skype calls
